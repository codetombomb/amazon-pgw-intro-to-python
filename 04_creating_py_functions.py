# Create a function called my_function that takes in a parameter (param) - prints "Running my function" and returns param + 1

# Call the function without passing in an arg

# Create a function called say_hi that takes in an optional arg of name and prints "Hello, {name_that_was_passed_in}"

# Create an add_and_print function that takes two numbers - adds them and prints the value.

# Define a function without a body and use the pass keyword

# ====================== MOAR PRACTICE!! ======================

# Define a method greet_programmer() that takes no arguments. It should output the string "Hello, programmer!" to the terminal with print().

# Define a method greet() that takes one argument, a name. It should output the string "Hello, name!" (with "name" being whatever value was passed as an argument) to the terminal with print().

# Define a method greet_with_default() that takes one argument, a name. It should output the string "Hello, name!" (with "name" being whatever value was passed as an argument) to the terminal with print(). If no arguments are passed in, it should output the string "Hello, programmer!".

# Define a method add() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the sum of those two numbers.

# Define a method halve() that takes one number as an argument and returns the that number's value, divided by two.
